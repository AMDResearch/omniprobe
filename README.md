# logduration
logduration is a project that originally started simply to provide a quick and easy way to observe all kernel
durations within an application, without having to run the profiler and be saddled with all of the application
perturbation profiling involves (e.g. kernels are serialized). It's going to end up doing more than that though.

I've long had an interest in creating the capability to silently replace kernel objects in dispatch packets with
alternatives so that developers can experiment without having to rebuild entire applications. So I'm adding
the ability to logduration to point it at a kernel cache. What it wants is a directory containing any number of hsaco
files generated by the compiler. As the tool observes and logs kernel durations, which it pries out of
the dispatch completion_signal, if it finds a kernel in the kernel cache, with and identical name and parameter list,
it will silently replace the kernel the app dispatched with an equivalent kernel from the kernel cache.

Silently replacing kernels is a technique the Audacious Software team plans to use for its instrumented kernel functionality. 
But I suspect it will be really useful even just for doing comparative performance analysis while avoiding
the rebuilding of entire applications.
