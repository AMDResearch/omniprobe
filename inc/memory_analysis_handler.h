//! The conflict_set class is used in the analysis of LDS bank conflicts. LDS memory
//! is partitioned into 32 banks of 4-byte dwords each. If two lanes in a wavefront
//! access two different addresses on the same bank simultaneously, that is a bank
//! conflict: those accesses have to be serialized. But: the memory accesses for
//! all 64 lanes in a wavefront are executed in phases, and which lanes are active
//! in which phase depends on the size of the read/write. For instance, if we read
//! or write floats (4 bytes/a dword), then lanes 0..31 are executed in one phase,
//! and lanes 32..63 are executed in another phase. Only lanes that are executed
//! in the same phase can cause a bank conflict, so we'd never see a bank conflict
//! for float reads or writes between e.g. lane 0 and lane 48, even if these lanes
//! access different addresses on the same bank. A conflict set is a set of lanes
//! such that any two of them may cause a bank conflict.
//!
//! For accesses of size 1, 2, or 4 bytes, the conflict sets are {0..31} and {32..63}.
//!
//! For accesses of size 8 bytes, the conflict sets are {0..15}, {16,31}, {32..47},
//! and {48..63}.
//!
//! For accesses of size 16 bytes, the conflict sets are {0..3, 20..23},
//! {4..7, 16..19}, {8..11, 28..31}, {12..15, 24..27}, {32..35, 52..55},
//! {36..39, 48..51}, {40..43, 60..63} and {44..476, 56..59}. Note the the
//! eight lanes in each conflict group are not consecutive in this case; they
//! consist of two subsets of 4 consecutive lanes each, but there is a gap between
//! the subset.
//!
//! For an access to LDS, the number of bank conflicts for that access is the sum
//! of the bank conflicts for the corresponding conflict sets. For a conflict set,
//! the number of bank conflict is the maximum of the conflicts for all banks minus
//! one. In other words, it is the number of _additional_ memory requests that have
//! to be issued for the conflict set compared to an optimal access, where each bank
//! is accessed once.
